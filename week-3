Task-3
Paging & Sorting in Spring Boot (Pageable & Sort) - My Week 3 of Learning Spring Boot

I recently completed a practice task focused on Paging & Sorting in Spring Boot using Pageable and Sort. The task involved implementing efficient data retrieval methods to handle large datasets in a Spring Boot application.

Key Takeaways
Understanding Paging & Sorting
Spring Boot provides built-in support for pagination and sorting using the Pageable and Sort interfaces in Spring Data JPA. This helps optimize database queries and improve application performance.

Using Pageable for Pagination
By implementing the Pageable interface, I was able to fetch a subset of data, reducing the load on the database. The PageRequest.of(page, size) method allows fetching data page by page, improving efficiency in large applications.

Sorting Data with Sort
The Sort class in Spring Boot enables dynamic sorting of records based on different fields. Using Sort.by("fieldName").ascending() and Sort.by("fieldName").descending(), I implemented flexible sorting mechanisms.

Challenges and Solutions
Handling Large Datasets Efficiently
Initially faced performance issues when retrieving all records at once. Implementing pagination with Pageable helped optimize database queries and improve response times.

Combining Pagination and Sorting
Learned how to apply both pagination and sorting together using Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(page, size, Sort.by("field").descending()), allowing users to retrieve data in a structured manner.

Practical Application
Paging and sorting are essential for building scalable and responsive applications. By limiting and ordering data efficiently, I was able to enhance the user experience and database performance in my Spring Boot project.

Whatâ€™s Next
Looking forward to exploring Spring Boot REST APIs with Pagination & Sorting and integrating it into a real-world application.
