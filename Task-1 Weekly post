Spring Boot Starter Dependencies - My Week 1 of Learning Spring Boot
"I recently completed a practice task focused on Spring Boot Starter Dependencies. The task involved setting up a Spring Boot project and exploring how starter dependencies streamline development by handling required libraries automatically.

🔑 Key Takeaways:
✅ Understanding Spring Boot Starters:
Spring Boot provides pre-configured dependency sets like spring-boot-starter-web for web applications and spring-boot-starter-data-jpa for database operations. These help avoid version conflicts and simplify project setup.

✅ Auto-Configuration Magic:
Spring Boot auto-configures beans based on the dependencies present in the classpath, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing productivity.

🚀 Challenges & Solutions:
🔹 Dependency Version Conflicts:
Initially faced some issues with conflicting dependencies, but specifying explicit versions in pom.xml resolved the problem.

🔹 Customizing Default Behavior:
By modifying application.properties, I was able to override default configurations like the embedded Tomcat port and database connection settings.

🌍 Practical Application:
Understanding starter dependencies is essential for building scalable Spring Boot applications. It ensures that developers can focus on business logic instead of dependency management.

🔄 Eager vs. Lazy Loading:
While working with Spring Data JPA, I explored how Eager loading fetches related entities immediately, whereas Lazy loading fetches them only when needed, improving performance in large applications.

🎯 What's Next?
Looking forward to building REST APIs with Spring Boot and integrating database operations using Spring Data JPA!
